# What is Rust

Rust is a modern general-purpose, multi-paradigm systems programming language programming language originally developed/sponsored by Mozilla. Rust is a statically typed compiled language mainly focused on safety, speed, and concurrency. Rust syntactically similar to C++ and supports a mix of imperative procedural, pure functional and object-oriented programming paradigms. Unlike other modern languages Rust achieves all of these memory safety guarantees at compile time, hence there is no run-time overhead, which makes final code as fast as C/C++, but far safer.
